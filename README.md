# pokapi
A barebone app that uses the http://pokeapi.co API using JS.

It's based on the [code along video tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2a0Xv3giho&t=0s) by Ryan Christiani @Rchristiani.

The code is almost the same as what he wrote in the video tutorial.
Clone it or fork it you want to go deeper into the API.

And don't forget to star it if it helped.

Enjoy,
Nick Rameau.
